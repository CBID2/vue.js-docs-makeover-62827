## What is Vue?

Vue (pronounced like "view") helps you build websites the way you'd organize a toolbox. Instead of scattered tools everywhere, Vue gives you organized components that you can [reuse and combine](/guides/quickstart/). It's built on the web technologies you already know like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but makes them work together more smoothly.

## What makes Vue different?

Most frameworks force you to go "all-in" from day one. With Vue, you can try it on one page, add features gradually, and scale up when you're ready. It adapts to your project, not the other way around.
